# Deployment Packages Memory

## ðŸ“¦ Key Concepts Learned

### Purpose of Deployment Packages
- Transfer business solutions from private development to production/client environments
- Maintain security by excluding sensitive data
- Ensure reproducible deployments
- Version control deliverables

### Package Structure
```
package/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                  # Code (no .env files)
â”œâ”€â”€ infrastructure/       # Bicep templates
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/             # Deployment automation
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/                # Documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ .env.example         # Template only
â””â”€â”€ DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md  # Instructions
```

### Security Rules
- **NEVER include**: Real .env files, API keys, passwords, certificates
- **ALWAYS include**: .env.example, security setup guide, required variables list

### Workflow
1. Develop in `/Azure-Business-Solutions/` (private, git-ignored)
2. Create package using scripts
3. Validate security (no credentials)
4. Transfer package to target location
5. Deploy using included instructions

### Key Scripts Created
- `/Azure-Business-Solutions/scripts/package-solution.sh` - General packaging
- `/Azure-Business-Solutions/scripts/export-for-client.sh` - Client-specific export

### Important Paths
- Business Solutions: `/home/jjhpe/Azure AI Engineer/Azure AI Services Container/Azure-Business-Solutions/`
- Learning Modules: `/home/jjhpe/Azure AI Engineer/Azure AI Services Container/Azure-AI-Learning-Modules/`

### Versioning Convention
`<project>_v<version>_<date>_<environment>.tar.gz`
Example: `expense-ai_v1.0_20250730_prod.tar.gz`

## ðŸŽ¯ Practice Scenarios

1. **Internal Deployment**: Dev â†’ Test â†’ Prod
2. **Client Delivery**: Package with documentation
3. **Team Sharing**: Exclude development artifacts
4. **Archive**: Versioned snapshots for rollback

## ðŸ”’ Security Checklist
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials
- [ ] .env.example includes all variables
- [ ] Deployment guide is comprehensive
- [ ] Package tested in clean environment
- [ ] Version documented
- [ ] Rollback procedure included
