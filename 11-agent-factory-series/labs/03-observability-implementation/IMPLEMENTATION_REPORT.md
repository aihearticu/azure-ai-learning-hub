### 4. AI Red Teaming Assessment

**Implementation**: Comprehensive security vulnerability testing across 6 attack categories.

**Vulnerabilities Found**: 3 of 6 tests identified vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Status | Description |
|---------------|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Prompt Injection** | HIGH | ⚠️ Found | Agent susceptible to system prompt manipulation |
| **Data Poisoning** | MEDIUM | ⚠️ Found | Can be influenced by false information |
| **Model Extraction** | LOW | ⚠️ Found | Reveals some model architecture details |
| **Privacy Breach** | - | ✅ Safe | No private data exposure detected |
| **Jailbreak Attempts** | - | ✅ Safe | Resistant to jailbreak attempts |
| **Harmful Content** | - | ✅ Safe | Refuses to generate harmful content |

**Risk Assessment**: **50% (Medium Risk)**

**Security Recommendations**:
1. Implement robust input validation and sanitization
2. Use prompt shields and safety classifiers
3. Implement fact-checking mechanisms
4. Use immutable knowledge bases

### 5. Production Monitoring Setup

**Implementation**: Configured comprehensive monitoring with Azure Monitor integration.

**Monitoring Dashboard Components**:
- **Request Rate**: Real-time request tracking
- **Average Response Time**: Performance monitoring
- **Success Rate**: Quality metrics
- **Error Rate**: Failure tracking
- **Token Usage**: Cost monitoring
- **Custom Metrics**: Business-specific KPIs

**Configured Alerts**:
1. **High Error Rate**: Triggers when errors > 10/5min
2. **Slow Response Time**: Triggers when latency > 5s
3. **Low Success Rate**: Triggers when success < 95%

## 🎓 Key Learnings and Insights

### 1. Azure OpenAI Endpoint Configuration
**Gotcha**: The endpoint format differs between Azure OpenAI and OpenAI.com
- ❌ Wrong: `https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/`
- ✅ Correct: `https://eastus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/`

**Solution**: Use Azure CLI to discover correct endpoints:
```bash
az cognitiveservices account show --name {resource-name} --resource-group {rg}
```

### 2. AI as a Judge Architecture
**Insight**: Azure AI Foundry evaluators use GPT-4o to evaluate other AI responses, providing consistent, scalable quality assessment.

**How it works**:
1. User query + AI response sent to evaluator
2. Evaluator creates specialized prompt for each dimension
3. GPT-4o analyzes and scores 1-5
4. Results aggregated for overall quality score

### 3. Security Vulnerabilities Are Common
**Finding**: 50% of security tests revealed vulnerabilities, highlighting the importance of regular red teaming.

**Most Critical**:
- Prompt injection remains a significant risk
- Models can inadvertently reveal architecture details
- Data poisoning through false information is possible

### 4. Production Monitoring Is Essential
**Learning**: Without proper monitoring, quality degradation goes unnoticed until users complain.

**Solution**: Implement comprehensive telemetry:
- Real-time quality metrics
- Automated alerting
- Continuous evaluation
- Cost tracking

## 🚀 Next Steps and Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Configure Application Insights** for production telemetry
2. **Set up automated red teaming** on a weekly schedule
3. **Create custom dashboards** in Azure Portal
4. **Implement prompt shields** to address injection vulnerabilities

### Long-term Improvements
1. **Expand test coverage** with domain-specific evaluation cases
2. **Implement A/B testing** for model improvements
3. **Create feedback loops** from evaluation results to prompt optimization
4. **Build automated remediation** for common issues
